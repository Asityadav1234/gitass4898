## A simple introduction to the concept and its importance.

</br>

The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors, 
and the cosine of the angle between them.
- Dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation.
- It takes two equal-length sequences of numbers, and returns a single number.
- In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used.

## What is a Vector Dot Product?
The dot product of two vectors, **A** and **B**, is defined as:
<p><b>A · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)</b></p>

Where:
- $A$ and $B$ are the two vectors.
- $|A|$ and $|B|$ are the magnitudes of the vectors.
- $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.

In the image above, you can observe how the vector dot product relates geometrically to the projection of one vector onto another. The closer the angle between the vectors is to zero (parallel), the larger the dot product becomes, and when the vectors are perpendicular, the dot product equals zero.

## Python Code for Calculating the Dot Product

Below is a simple Python implementation to calculate the dot product of two vectors using a function.

### Example Code Snippet

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    """
    Calculate the dot product of two vectors.
    
    Args:
    vector_a: List or tuple representing the first vector.
    vector_b: List or tuple representing the second vector.
    
    Returns:
    float: The dot product of the two vectors.
    """
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

vector_a = [1, 2, 3]
vector_b = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector_a, vector_b)
print(f"The dot product of {vector_a} and {vector_b} is: {result}")
```

## Invention of vector dot product
> The dot product, also known as the scalar product, was not invented by a single person,</br>
> but is a well-established mathematical operation.</br>
> In 1773, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the component form of both</br>
> the dot and cross products in order to study the tetrahedron in three dimensions.</br>
> In 1843, William Rowan Hamilton introduced the quaternion product, and with it the terms "vector" and "scalar".</br>
