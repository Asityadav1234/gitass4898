The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors, 
and the cosine of the angle between them.
- Dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation.
- It takes two equal-length sequences of numbers, and returns a single number.
- In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used.

### _Python code for Vector Dot product_

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    return sum(a * b for a, b in (vector_a, vector_b))
```

### Invention of vector dot product
> The dot product, also known as the scalar product, was not invented by a single person,</br>
> but is a well-established mathematical operation.</br>
> In 1773, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the component form of both</br>
> the dot and cross products in order to study the tetrahedron in three dimensions.</br>
> In 1843, William Rowan Hamilton introduced the quaternion product, and with it the terms "vector" and "scalar".</br>
